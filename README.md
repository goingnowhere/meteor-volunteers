# Meteor Volunteers

This is the core logic of the volunteer management system used at the [Nowhere event](www.goingnowhere.org).

It's designed to be a reusable module which can be pulled into any Meteor project in order to add the capability to organise teams of volunteers.

## Notes

It was originally written in Coffeescript using Blaze as the view layer. In order to increase the pool of potential contributors and to escape the poor development experience of Blaze it is currently being ported to React and Javascript.

If you're looking to contribute, you most likely want to start looking at the only current project which uses this module which can be found [here](https://github.com/goingnowhere/volunteers-nowhere) as otherwise you will need to write the supporting code to use the module yourself.
